            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Rafi's here!
                I am everyone's best friend. People call me Businessman even though I am just doing it for gaining
                experiences. I am studying CSE at IUB doing my work 'Hello Google'. Though I had to struggle a lot but I
                am always motivated and trying new things is my new hobby nowadays. Girls fall for me easily I guess I
                am kinda Posh Guy! Anyway I love to do what I like.I have been learning web development and android/Java
                programming during my leisure time. I think this is a good investment of my time as it prepares me for
                the upcoming world. I beleive that in future every one will have to learn atleast some coding.
                Also, i find it very satisfying to learn something new instead of wasting time on social media</p>
