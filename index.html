            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Rafi's here!
                I am everyone's best friend. People call me Businessman even though I am just doing it for gaining
                experiences. I am studying CSE at IUB doing my work 'Hello Google'. Though I had to struggle a lot but I
                am always motivated and trying new things is my new hobby nowadays. Girls fall for me easily I guess I
                am kinda Posh Guy! Anyway I love to do what I like.I have been learning web development and android/Java
                programming during my leisure time. I think this is a good investment of my time as it prepares me for
                the upcoming world. I beleive that in future every one will have to learn atleast some coding.
                Also, i find it very satisfying to learn something new instead of wasting time on social media</p>

                <h3>Chili Cheese Burger</h3>
                <p>I’m not a big soup fan, but I love chili. Chili is a winner in my book because it’s thick, hardy and
                    preferably spicy. When I saw the idea of a Chili Cheese Burger I knew I had to give it a try.</p>

                <h3>In-N-Out Burger</h3>
                <p>Not much beats In-N-Out when it comes to fast food burgers. Unfortunately, if you don’t live in one
                    of a
                    few states where they have one, you’re out of luck. The good news is you can recreate the flavor
                    with
                    this In-N-Out burger recipe in your own kitchen.</p>

                <h3>Caprese Burger</h3>
                <p>The caprese burger is a take on a caprese salad, which has fresh mozzarella cheese, tomato, and
                    basil. If
                    you haven’t had this, it’s an awesome, fresh tasting combo. It’s also very similar to bruschetta.
